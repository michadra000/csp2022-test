  <h1>Welcome to Overwatch</h1>
  <p>Overwatch is the best game in my opinion because of how it is set up, it is a 5v5 online battle game where you play as either a <a href="https://bloygo.yoigo.com/embed/f23a8c2468f1e40c7b9c127996c2901ca67021666012623/Heroes-Overwatch-2.jpg?imagick=1&size=750">tank</a>, a <a href="https://preview.redd.it/f8wscctgvp381.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4d3505911ec9be6d5c324ab40472d3aaeafe34a1">support</a>, or a <a href="https://i0.wp.com/gamertagzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/damage-hero-changes.jpg?resize=637%2C631&ssl=1">damage</a>
  character and those different catagories of characters have their own special abilities and attributes like tanks for example have way more health then a healer 
  and they are ment to take all the heavy damage while the Support characters dont have much health but they can heal other players with either magic or guns, damage on the 
  other hand is a clear mixture of both, damage do the most damage but dont have the most health and dont have the best healing abilities but instead they have the 
  best damage dealing attacks and are the best to fight people with. Overwatch has many modes and different characters to discover and I hope you will try it out for
  yourself.</p>
  
  <p><strong> The different role's in Overwatch do different things to suport their team, <a href="https://bloygo.yoigo.com/embed/f23a8c2468f1e40c7b9c127996c2901ca67021666012623/Heroes-Overwatch-2.jpg?imagick=1&size=750">Tanks</a> hero's role is to take the most damage and protect the other players by keeping the damage on them while creating things like
    barriers and shields with their abilities to assist them in their team. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/gamertagzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/damage-hero-changes.jpg?resize=637%2C631&ssl=1">Damage</a> hero's role is to do the most damage possible for their team to help kill the other teams hero's, they often have abilities that help them do more damage or transportation so they get to the fight quicker.

 <section><ul> The different game modes in quick play are <li>Escort,the attacking team's objective is to move the payload to a delivery point, while the defenders must halt the attackers' progress until time runs out.</li>, <li>Hybrid, the players need to gain possession of an objective location where the payload is located, and the attacking team must first engage the defenders in combat.</li>, <li>Control, This means that there is no distinction to attacking or defending teams like in other game modes. Once the match has started and both teams have left the spawn, the control point takes 30 seconds to unlock.</li>, <li>Push, two teams fight for control of a robot, which can move a barricade for each team. When controlled by one team, the robot will move in the direction of the enemy spawn along a set track. If the robot reaches the location of the controlling team's barricade, it will slowly push it along the track.</li> </ul></section>
